## But 2015 is a New Year

To fulfill the goals weâ€™ve set and to continue to provide a solid foundation of quality arts education, we need your support.

Your donation helps us educate, encourage and inspire our students. It helps us cultivate their artistic abilities and grow in the arts. It also helps us to offer opportunities for our students to share their wonderful gifts with the community through different performances, art shows, readings and more!

As little as $10 a month allows us to fulfill our mission and continue to be an arts education center where favoritism is not an option, honesty with and between students, parents and staff is first and foremost, and each student is gives as much attention, guidance and instruction as possible.
